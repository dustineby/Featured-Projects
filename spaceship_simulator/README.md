# Spaceship Simulator

Final project for a data structures class, this project implements a quad tree (also made) to store randomly egnerated clusters of planets. The entire "generated galaxy" is shown in one panel, another panel shows a player-controlled rocket ship and nearby planets. Collision turns planets yellow. The view is smoother than the gifs show.
